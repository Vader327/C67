Once upon a time, there was an old tortoise. He used to be friends with a hare. The hare always used to boast about how faster he is than the tortoise. The tortoise got fed up and challenged the hare to a race. The hare agreed. They went to a flat place and marked a tree as a finishing line. "Whoever reaches the tree first wins the race", the tortoise said. They began the race. The hare, fast as ever, ran across the racetrack. He observed that the tortoise was still a few inches from the start and laughed hard. He decided to take a nap because he knew that by the time he would wake up, the tortoise would still have not reached up to him. A few minutes later, the hare woke up from his slumber. He was shocked that the tortoise had almost reached the finish line. The tortoise was only a few steps away. The hare ran as quickly as possible, but could not make it in time. The tortoise had won the race. The hare felt embarresed that a tortoise beat him in a race, but the tortoise told him he should not have napped. The hare finally learned his lesson to always use all opportunities and never leave any.
